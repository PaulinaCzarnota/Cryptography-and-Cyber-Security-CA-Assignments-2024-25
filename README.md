This repository contains my CA assignments for the Cryptography and Cyber Security module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin.

# Assignment 1: Lab Report

### Overview

This assignment consists of **five labs** of my choice, each covering different cybersecurity concepts and practical skills. The labs were completed using Kali Linux and relevant tools such as Python, Bash, Hydra, Hashcat, CeWL, GnuPG, and iptables. Each lab includes hands-on tasks, real-world applications, and personal reflections.

### Included Labs

* **Lab 2**: Classical Encryption Techniques (Caesar, Vigen√®re, Columnar Transposition)
* **Lab 3**: Brute Force Attacks, Hash Cracking with Hashcat, and Wordlist Generation with CeWL
* **Lab 4**: Writing a Self-Replicating Python Virus
* **Lab 6**: Firewall Configuration Using iptables
* **Lab 8**: Public-Key Cryptography with GnuPG (Encryption, Signing, and Verification)

### Highlights

* Used Pycipher and Bash scripts to explore and break classical encryption schemes.
* Performed real brute-force login attacks using Hydra and analyzed real-world password leaks with Hashcat.
* Created a self-replicating malware script in Python to understand how viruses propagate.
* Configured iptables rules on Kali to allow only essential services and block all others.
* Practiced secure file encryption and digital signing with GnuPG.

# Assignment 2: Final Cryptography & Cybersecurity Project

### Overview

The final assignment focused on applying theoretical knowledge to real-world cybersecurity problems through five distinct tasks involving RSA encryption, digital signatures, frequency analysis, image encryption, and cybersecurity tools on Kali Linux.

### Tasks Summary

* **Task 1**: Personal reflection video and presentation on key skills learned (e.g., AES, RSA, Hashcat, iptables, malware analysis).
* **Task 2**: Designed and simulated a secure RSA communication system ensuring both confidentiality and authenticity using public/private keys and digital signatures.
* **Task 3**: Decrypted a monoalphabetic substitution cipher using frequency analysis techniques and tools like dCode and Quipqiup.
* **Task 4**: Answered technical Kali-related questions on public key sharing, brute-force tools, IP discovery, and Python usage.
* **Task 5**: Implemented AES encryption on an image using ECB and CBC modes in Python, demonstrating how block cipher modes impact visual data.

### Highlights

* Built full RSA communication flow between sender and recipient with key generation, signing, and encryption.
* Successfully cracked a substitution cipher using classical statistical methods.
* Applied theoretical encryption concepts directly through Python and Linux-based scripting.
* Demonstrated understanding of cryptographic vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques in lab-based simulations.
